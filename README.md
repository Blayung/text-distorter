# Text distorter
A python script to distort text.  
  
Usage: `python3 distort.py <0-100> <some text>`, where 0 is no distortion at all, and 100 is complete garbage unrelated to the input.  
  
Example:  
![something has gone wrong, there was supposed to be an image in here :\\](https://github.com/Blayung/text-distorter/assets/92673316/8fcb1497-a14e-45ed-8280-d32dda1bbd6a)
